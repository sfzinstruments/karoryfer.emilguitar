Epiphone Emily the Strange guitar played and mapped by D. Smolken.

SFZ mappings included:
Basic - all samples, nothing fancy
Clean - as above minus string muting samples on note release
Three voice - three round robins at once
Five voice - five voices created by pitch-shifting four higher samples down to match the note being played
Chords - power, minor and major barre chords with keyswitches
Chords wide - as above but with the strings spread out in stereo

Standard tuning though the low E string was also sampled tuned down to Db. The strings are d'Addario Chromes flatwounds, 11 gauge. All samples recorded direct, using both pickups and all knobs on ten.
Notes have four velocity layers and three round robins, release samples four round robins, noises five round robins.
